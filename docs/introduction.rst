Introduction
============

``riboraptor`` library is aPython librara for analysis of Ribo-seq data.
It assumes the reads have already been aligned to a reference and are available as BAM/SAM for input. Detailed
instructions for mapping are available elsewhere [TODO: Instructions for mapping].

Current capabilities of ``riboraptor`` include:

:Visualization:
    - Read length distribution
    - Metagene coverage
    - Possible pausing sites

:Utilities:
    - Mapping summary statistics
    - 5'UTR/CDS/3'UTR coverage
    - P-site offset calculation
