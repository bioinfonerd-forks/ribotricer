# Robustly detecting actively translating ORFs from Ribo-seq data

## Installation
We highly recommend that you install RiboCop via conda
```bash
conda install -c bioconda ribocop
```

------------------

## Workflow of RiboCop

In order to run RiboCop, you need to have the following three files
prepared including:
* **genome annotation file** in GTF format, supporting both GENCODE and
Ensembl annotation
* **reference genome file** in FASTA format
* **alignment file** in BAM format

### Prepare candidate ORFs
The first step of RiboCop is to take the GTF file and the FASTA file to find all
candidate ORFs. In order to generate all candidate ORFs, please run
```bash
RiboCop prepare-orfs --gtf {GTF} --fasta {FASTA} --prefix {PREFIX}
```
The command above by default only includes ORFs with length longer than 60 nts,
and only uses 'ATG' as start codon. You can change the setting by including
options ```--min_orf_length``` and ```--start_codons```.  
Outputs:
  * _{PREFIX}\_candidate\_orfs.tsv_.

### Detecting translating ORFs
The second step of RiboCop is to take the index file generated by ```prepare-orfs```
and the BAM file to detect the actively translating ORFs by assessing the periodicity
of all candidate ORFs:
```bash
RiboCop detect-orfs --bam {BAM} --ribocop_index {PREFIX}_candidate_ORFs.tsv --prefix {PREFIX}
```
The ORF detection step consists of several small steps including:
1. Infer the experimental protocol (strandedness of the reads)
You can directly assign the strandedness by using option ```--stranded```, it can be 'yes',
'no', or 'reverse'. If this option is not provided, RiboCop will automatically infer the
experimental protocol by comparing the strand of reads to the reference.   
Outputs:
    * _{PREFIX}\_protocol.txt_
